# MongoDB vs MySQL Performance Comparison for Social Media Big Data Management

This project aims to compare the performance of queries between MongoDB and MySQL for managing big data in a social media application. The focus is on measuring the efficiency of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and retrieving user comments.

## Overview

The project includes two main classes: `MySQLMain` for MySQL database operations and `MongoDBMain` for MongoDB database operations. Both classes perform similar functionalities to create users and retrieve their comments, allowing for a direct comparison of performance.

## MySQL Implementation

The `MySQLMain` class utilizes the `MySQLSolution` class to interact with the MySQL database. It generates sample user data, creates users in the database, and retrieves comments for all users. Performance metrics such as the time taken for each operation are measured and printed.

## MongoDB Implementation

The `MongoDBMain` class employs the `MongoDBSolution` class to manage data in MongoDB. It follows a similar approach to the MySQL implementation, generating sample user data, creating user documents, and retrieving user comments. Performance metrics, including the time taken for document creation and comment retrieval, are measured and displayed.

## Performance Metrics

Both implementations measure the time taken for key operations, including user creation and comment retrieval. By comparing these metrics between MySQL and MongoDB, the project aims to provide insights into the performance characteristics of each database system for big data management in a social media application.

## Conclusion

Through this project, developers and database administrators can gain valuable insights into the performance differences between MySQL and MongoDB when handling large volumes of data in a social media context. These insights can inform decision-making processes regarding database selection and optimization strategies.
